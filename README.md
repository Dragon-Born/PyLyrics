##PyLyrics: A Pythonic Implementation of lyrics.wikia.com

PyLyrics is a python module to get Lyrics of songs from lyrics.wikia.com. It has support for getting albums of a singer and songs from an album from which lyrics can be accessed.

This module is under development and will be available on PyPI soon.

####But lyrics.wikia.com already has an API right?

Well the API is there but it seriously sucks. You get only 5 lines of lyrics which isn't what any of us want. To get the rest you have to open your browser. This is where PyLyrics fits in. It improves the API by providing more methods and better abstraction. PyLyrics internally uses the lyrics.wikia.com API for getting songs from Albums but the rest part of the API uses solely beautifulsoup for scraping lyrics.wikia.com
